# Lab8

n this lab, you are going to implement merge sort.
You can clone base code from the repository https://github.com/neslimsah/lab_8.git. You are supposed
to implement body of the function mergeSort and test your code using the input files provided. You
must use Alloc and DeAlloc functions provided to allocate and deallocate memory. You cannot use
malloc or free. Please note that if malloc/realloc/calloc or free used, assignment will be graded as 0.
1. You are going to clone my github repository under your github account, and will implement the
sort function body.
2. Your submission will be the repository url of your implementation. Per your submission, the TAs
will be able to clone your repository and compile and run it.
3. If you have specific build instructions, please update your README file accordingly.
4. You cannot make any updates to your code after the submission deadline. Even if you do so, we
will be able to track your updates, hence you will lose points for making a change after the
submission deadline.
